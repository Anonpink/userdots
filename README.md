# 🌸 userdots

> A curated collection of my personal dotfiles — minimal, clean, and tailored for efficient daily development.

`userdots` is my portable, version-controlled setup for a Unix-like environment. It includes configs and customizations for tools I use daily, focused on speed, clarity, and aesthetic consistency.

Heavily inspired by [antiX Linux](https://antixlinux.com/) — lightweight, fast, and free-spirited. Love antiX, btw. ❤️
